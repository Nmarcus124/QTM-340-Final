## Examining the New York Times as a Reflection of Public Opinion in the 2016 Presidential Election
by Nati Marcus and James Dugle

This repo contains an iPython notebook with data collection and sentiment analysis study of New York Times articles pertaining to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the 2016 Presidential Election Campaign. Data was collected through the NYT archive API and NLP analysis was conducted using `nltk VADER` and `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer`. Simple Linear Regression was conducted to examine the relationship between sentiment scores of these articles and polling data at the time they were written.

Findings from the study can be found in this [article](https://medium.com/swlh/examining-the-new-york-times-as-a-reflection-of-public-opinion-in-the-2016-presidential-election-70c255097785) posted on Medium's *The Startup*.
